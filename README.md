# 📊 Superstore Sales Analysis (Python + Pandas)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover revenue trends, profitability drivers, and operational insights using Python. The goal was to simulate a real-world data analyst workflow: data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and communicating actionable recommendations.

## Objectives
- Identify top-performing product categories
- Evaluate profit performance by region and segment
- Analyze the impact of discounting on margins
- Detect seasonal sales patterns

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## Key Insights
- Technology drives the highest total sales but profit varies by region.
- Higher discount levels correlate with lower profit margins.
- Sales consistently peak in Q4, indicating strong seasonality.
- Certain sub-categories underperform despite strong order volume.

## Recommendations
- Tighten discount strategies on low-margin products.
- Prepare inventory and marketing ahead of Q4 demand spikes.
- Reassess pricing or shipping costs in low-profit regions.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset
3. Run cells sequentially

## Outcome
This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and business storytelling—core competencies required for entry-level data analyst roles.
